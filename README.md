Olde Pascal Program
========================

These are some programs I wrote back in high school using Borland Pascal.
With the miracle of DOSBox, they can almost live again!

Running
--------

To run the programs, first install DOSBox. When it starts, execute:

    mount d /path/to/olde_pascal
    d:
    
From there, you should be able to run each .EXE file in its directory. Note that
using the "D:\" drive is critical, as the path to Borland's BGI graphics
libraries is hard-coded.

Programs
----------

* blackjack
  * A half-working version of Blackjack which apparently has cheap codes. It
    seems to accidentally tell you what your hidden card is sometimes.
* mike_os
  * My personal GUI for launching an image editor and image viewer. I stole the
    background from Windows 95. The original version also had the stolen start
    up sound.
* nim
  * An animated version of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim](Nim), which I
    have no idea how to play anymore.
* pong
  * My first game, with a single pixel for the ball and an unbeatable A.I.!
* space
  * Easily my most complex game. Local multiplayer space shooter with missiles,
    shields, and even a computer player. I can't figure out what most of the
    weapons do.
* InOS
  * An "advanced" windowing system that I was going to use to take over the
    world. Then Bill Gates beat me to it.
